## Artisan Cap Casting
```
We have received the following recommendation from Binge (the creator of the $ynth).  I encourage you to read it to protect your investment and contact Binge with any additional questions at binge@hungerwork.studio 

The :~$ynth mold system is best used in conjunction with a Polysiloxane mold release agent.  This is a common release agent used to aid in the release of plastics from plastics, rubber, and metal.  For first time use please apply up to 3 coatings of your release agent in thin layers allowing the release agent to cure on the surface of all :~$ynth mold system parts. If you are unsure if your release agent manufacturer uses this active ingredient please contact their technical staff for clarification.  Known and tested Polysiloxane mold release agents in the United States are:  ReleaSys 78 (Aerosol) & Alumilite UMR (Aerosol).  Mann Ease Release 200 (Aerosol) may also be used although effectiveness is subject to coating thickness and may cause cure inhibition.
